# Load Balancing

Virtual machine load balancing is the problem of distributing virtual machines
in a way that evenly balances CPU and memory requirements across a set of hosts,
preventing overload or under-utilization of host machines. It is a real-world
problem for many organizations, including D-Wave.

## Installation

You can run this example without installation in cloud-based IDEs that support
the
[Development Containers specification](https://containers.dev/supporting) (aka
"devcontainers") such as GitHub Codespaces.

For development environments that do not support `devcontainers`, install
requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are cloning the repo to your local system, working in a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is
recommended.

## Usage

Your development environment should be configured to access the
[Leap&trade; quantum cloud service](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/ocean/sapi_access_basic.html).
You can see information about supported IDEs and authorizing access to your Leap
account
[here](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/leap_sapi/dev_env.html).

Run the following terminal command to start the Dash application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The demo program opens an interface where you can configure problems and submit
these problems to a solver.

Configuration options can be found in the [demo_configs.py](demo_configs.py)
file.

> If you plan on editing any files while the application is running, please run
the application with the `--debug` command-line argument for live reloads and
easier debugging: `python app.py --debug`

## Problem Description

**Objective**: To balance the system such that each host has similar memory and
CPU demands.

**Constraints**: (1) Each virtual machine can only be assigned to one host. (2)
Total resource demands on a single host must be less than or equal to the
per-host proportional allocation of capacity.

## Model Overview

### Parameters

-   Hosts: Each with an ID, current CPU use, current memory use, CPU capacity,
    and memory capacity.
-   Virtual Machines: Each with an ID, CPU requirement, and memory requirement.
-   Priority: Whether to prioritize balancing CPU or memory.

### Variables

-   `{vm}_on_{host}`: Binary variable that shows if virtual machine is assigned
    to host.

### Objective

Our objective is to assign virtual machines to hosts such that the resource
demands for CPU and memory are equally distributed between hosts.

The `Priority` setting enables you to choose between prioritizing CPU or memory
balancing. The prioritized resource is set as a hard constraint while the other
resource is a soft constraint.

### Constraints

#### One Host per Virtual Machine

Each virtual machine can only be assigned to one host. To accomplish this we use
a one-hot constraint for discrete `{vm}_on_{host}` variables.

#### Proportional Allocation

The sum of CPU and memory requirements on a host must be less than or equal to
the proportional allocation of the host. This proportional allocation is that
host's resource capacity divided by the total resource capacity of all hosts
multiplied by the total demand of all virtual machines.

The priority between resources (memory or CPU) is set with the
`Balance Priority`, which switches between hard and soft constraints for the two
resources.
